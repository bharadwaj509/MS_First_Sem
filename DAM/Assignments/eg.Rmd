This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




```{r}
x1=rnorm(200,1,2)
y=1+2*x1+rnorm(200)
model=lm(y~x1)
model
```

What about this?

```{r echo=FALSE}
x1=rnorm(200,1,2)
y=1+2*x1+rnorm(200)
model=lm(y~x1)
model
```

And this?

```{r eval=FALSE}
x1=rnorm(200,1,2)
y=1+2*x1+rnorm(200)
model=lm(y~x1)
model
```

Even this?

```{r results="hide"}
x1=rnorm(200,1,2)
y=1+2*x1+rnorm(200)
model=lm(y~x1)
model
```

Lastly, try this?

```{r }
x1=rnorm(200,1,2)
y=1+2*x1+rnorm(200)
model=lm(y~x1)
summary(model)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(y~x1)
abline(a=model$coef[1],b=model$coef[2],lwd=2,col="red")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The slope is `r model$coef[2]`.  The intercept is `r model$coef[1]`.  Don't use `model$coef[2]`.

The function `lm` is useful.

## Getting started
To work with R Markdown, if necessary:

* Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
* Install the lastest version of [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download/) (at time of posting, this is 0.96)
* Install the latest version of the `knitr` package: `install.packages("knitr")`

To run the basic working example that produced this blog post:

1. Open R Studio, and go to File - New - R Markdown
2. If necessary install `ggplot2` and `lattice` packages: `install.packages("ggplot2"); install.packages("lattice") `
3. Paste in the contents of this gist (which contains the R Markdown file used to produce this post) and save the file with an `.rmd` extension
4. Click Knit HTML

The regression is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_0 x_i + e_i$.  We can also write

$$\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$$
